# Profit Prediction with Machine Learning üìàüíª

Predicting profit is a crucial task for businesses as it helps them set realistic goals and allocate resources efficiently. By predicting profits based on factors like R&D spend and marketing expenses, businesses can optimize their investments and set achievable targets. This project explores how to predict a company's profit using machine learning models and a dataset containing key financial metrics.

In this project, we build a profit prediction model using **Gradient Boosting Regressor**, and the whole pipeline is integrated for easy deployment using **Streamlit**. You can try out the live demo on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zafermbilen/profit-prediction).

## üîç Problem Statement

Companies need to set realistic goals to keep their teams motivated and ensure efficient resource utilization. If a company can predict its profits based on investments in R&D, administration, and marketing, it can plan better strategies and optimize these investments. This project aims to predict a company‚Äôs profit using historical data.

## üöÄ Live Demo

The model is deployed as a web application using **Streamlit** and is available at Hugging Face Spaces. You can access the live demo here:

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

| Column Name       | Description                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `R&D Spend`       | Research and Development (R&D) expenditure in dollars.                  |
| `Administration`  | Administrative expenses in dollars.                                     |
| `Marketing Spend` | Marketing expenses in dollars.                                          |
| `State`           | The state where the company is located (New York, California, Florida). |
| `Profit`          | The profit earned by the company in dollars.                            |

This dataset allows us to explore how different types of expenditures contribute to a company‚Äôs profit and helps in building a predictive model.
